data_fabric has two layers of tests: unit tests and integration tests.


== Running the Unit Tests

The unit tests test both with and without an actual database.  test/database_test.rb
tests against a database.  The other unit tests mock AR so no actual database is 
required.  You can use the standard test/database.yml which tests against SQLite3
or customize the provided test/database.yml.mysql.  The "rake create_db" task will
set up the necessary databases and tables.


== Running the Integration Tests

data_fabric ships with an example application which shows an actual Rails application
using data_fabric.  You can customize config/database.yml but by default it uses a local
Sqlite3 database so there should be no customization necessary.

Run the Rake task to prepare the application for testing.  This will copy the latest data_fabric code
to vendor/plugins, delete existing databases and migrate all the databases from scratch.  You should
then be able to run the example application's tests.

 cd example
 rake app:prepare
 rake test
